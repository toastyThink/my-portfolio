A brief summary of who you are: 

Hey There! 

I'm Brendan, I'm a versatile Fullstack Developer who seamlessly blends the worlds of technology and design. 
With a unique background in Human Resources and visual design, I bring a holistic perspective to 
my development projects.

My journey began in Human Resources, where I honed my interpersonal skills and gained a 
deep understanding of user needs. Transitioning into visual design allowed me to express 
creativity and enhance my problem-solving abilities. Now, as a Fullstack Developer, I seamlessly 
integrate my diverse skill set to create user-centric and visually appealing applications.
